Greetings! 

I'm jeremy, and i'm learning front end web development. my prior exposure to programming has been html and css. this time i'll build on my foundation, design sites from scratch and also learn js, jQuery (and accompanying languages) in order to make a smooth transition from a career in technical recruiting to a career in web development. 

Exciting times!
